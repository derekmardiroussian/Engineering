Week 2<br>   
This week, we started off on Monday by doing a challenge with the class split up into two sides. The objective was that we had to lign up and we each had one pipe that we had to pass one marble through. This had to continue all the way until the marble went into the bucket at the end of the line. This was a very fun experience that had to use the combined creativity of your group. <br>On Wednesday, we started to design our Rube Goldberg Machines. This was first supposed to be drawn on paper and then put together in tinkercad when finished.<br> Finally, on Friday, we were supposed to bring an item from home to the class. Then we were supposed to design said item on tinkercad in which two judges picked their sides winner. The winner got a kit kat bar. I designed the eiffil tower, which is a very complicated piece to make with shapes as it is curved and has many different designs.
